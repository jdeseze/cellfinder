# Cellfinder

This is a small code to find cells that are positively transfected

To launch the script, you must have a session of Metamorph or Micromanager open. 

The principle is simple: the script scans the coverslip you are looking at, takes pictures and saves positions (and picture) when it finds a cell. 
You then have a tool to select the cells you want to keep, and it will create a position file, which can be imported in Metamorph or in Micromanager.
